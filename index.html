<h2> Background</h2>
      <p>The current website requires a modernized design, improved user experience, and upgraded features to better serve the needs of its diverse community of playwrights, industry professionals, and the general public.

        Problem: Emerging playwrights seek recognition and opportunities within the Canadian theatre scene but face challenges in navigating the industry. They lack visibility, resources, and meaningful connections to showcase their work and advance their creative work.
        
        How might we develop a user-friendly platform that empowers users to network, access resources, and gain visibility within the theater community, enabling them to establish a sustainable career in the industry?
